Selenium is a tool that uses normal browsers to do testing of websites, 
but it also can be used for scraping.

All browsers can be used via Xvfb virtual terminal.
Chromium v59 above supports headless mode, so can be used without Xvfb. 


INSTALLATION

1. // Use npm package manager to install selenium
   npm install selenium-webdriver
   "selenium-webdriver": "^3.4.0",

2. DRIVERS for Selenium (Chromium, Chrome, Firefox, etc)

2a. Chromium driver
   Chromium installs to /usr/lib/chromium
   To test if it is installed, enter 'chromedriver' in terminal, shows 2.29
   Debian:  see debianInstallChromedriver.sh
   NPM: in package.json:  "chromedriver": "^2.29.0",
   Arch: yaourt -S chromedriver  Note: IT SEEMS Chromium already comes installed with Chromedriver;
   the package chromedriver is in conflict. 

2b. Chrome
    Chrome installs to /opt/google/chrome-unstable/chrome
    Chrome v60 itself does not work. This gets errors: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43982934/selenium-webdriverjs-javascript-with-chrome
          https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/3070

2c. Firefox:   
    yaourt -S geckodriver   
    installs selenium driver for firefox.

    selenium has some issue with TEXT vs string that does not allow the scraping. This should be fixed soon.
